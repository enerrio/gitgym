You are working on the gitgym project.

## Instructions

1. Read specs/README.md (the Pin) to understand the full specification.
2. Read specs/PLAN.md to see the current implementation state.
3. Pick the FIRST task marked [ ] (not started). Do NOT skip ahead.
4. Implement ONLY that single task. Do not combine multiple tasks.
5. Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Use search to find how similar things are already done before writing new code.
6. Write tests for the task. Run them. Fix any failures.
7. If all tests pass, commit with a descriptive message referencing the task number (e.g., "task 2.1: add config module with workspace paths").
8. Update specs/PLAN.md: change [ ] to [x] for the completed task.
9. Stop. Do not continue to the next task.
