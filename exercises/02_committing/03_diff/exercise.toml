Before committing, it's good practice to review exactly what changed. \
`git diff` shows unstaged changes; `git diff --staged` shows what is \
staged and ready to commit.\n\
\n\
In this exercise `app.py` has been modified but not yet staged. \
Use `git diff` to inspect the changes, then stage and commit them.
