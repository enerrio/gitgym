description = """
A clean commit history tells a story. Instead of lumping all changes \
into one giant commit, good developers group related changes and commit \
them separately.\n\
\n\
In this exercise three files are waiting to be committed: `README.md`, \
`main.py`, and `utils.py`. Stage and commit each file individually with \
a meaningful message for each commit.

summary = "At least 3 commits exist, each with a non-empty message."

text = "Use `git add <file>` to stage one file at a time, then `git commit -m \"message\"`."

text = "Check `git status` between commits to track what still needs to be committed."

text = "Run these in sequence:\n  git add README.md && git commit -m \"Add README\"\n  git add main.py && git commit -m \"Add main script\"\n  git add utils.py && git commit -m \"Add utility functions\""
