title = "Resolve a Merge Conflict"
description = """
Sometimes two branches modify the same part of the same file. When you try to \
merge them, git cannot automatically reconcile the differences and reports a \
merge conflict. You must manually edit the file to resolve it, then stage and \
commit the result.

Both `main` and `feature` have modified the same line in `README.md`. Merge \
`feature` into `main`, resolve the conflict in `README.md`, and complete the merge.

summary = "Resolve the merge conflict in README.md and complete the merge commit."

text = "Run `git merge feature` to start the merge. Git will report a conflict in README.md."

text = "Open README.md and look for conflict markers: <<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. Edit the file to keep the content you want, removing all markers."

text = "After editing README.md, stage it with `git add README.md`, then complete the merge with `git commit`."
