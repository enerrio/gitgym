title = "Three-Way Merge"
description = """
When two branches have diverged — each has commits the other doesn't — git \
performs a three-way merge. Unlike a fast-forward, this creates a new merge \
commit that ties the histories together.

A `feature` branch was created from `main`, and then both branches received \
new commits independently. Merge `feature` into `main` to create a merge commit.
"""

[goal]
summary = "Merge the 'feature' branch into 'main', creating a merge commit."

[[hints]]
text = "Make sure you are on the 'main' branch before merging."

[[hints]]
text = "Use `git merge feature` to merge. Since both branches have diverged, git will create a merge commit."

[[hints]]
text = "Just run: git merge feature (while on 'main'). Git will open an editor for the commit message — save and close it."
