description = """
When a branch hasn't diverged from the base branch, git can merge it with a \
simple fast-forward — it just moves the branch pointer forward without creating \
a merge commit.

A `feature` branch has been created from `main` and has two additional commits. \
`main` has not changed since `feature` was branched off. Merge `feature` into \
`main` using a fast-forward merge.

summary = "Merge the 'feature' branch into 'main' via a fast-forward (no merge commit created)."

[[hints]]
text = "A fast-forward merge happens automatically when there are no diverging commits. Just run: git merge feature"
