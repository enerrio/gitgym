description = """
There are two ways to re-apply a stash:

- `git stash pop` — applies the stash **and** removes it from the stash list.
- `git stash apply` — applies the stash but **keeps** it in the stash list.

`apply` is useful when you want to apply the same stash to multiple branches \
or keep it as a backup while you review the changes.

In this repository, some changes have been stashed. Apply them to the working \
directory using `git stash apply` so that the stash entry remains in the list \
after applying.

summary = "The stashed changes are applied to the working directory, and the stash entry still exists in the stash list."
