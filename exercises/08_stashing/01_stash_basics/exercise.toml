`git stash` temporarily saves your uncommitted changes (both staged and \
unstaged) so you can work on something else, then come back and re-apply \
them later. Think of it as a clipboard for your in-progress work.

In this repository, you were in the middle of writing some notes when you \
had to step away. Your changes were stashed (saved aside) to keep the \
working directory clean. Use `git stash pop` to recover your work and \
apply the stashed changes back to the working directory.
