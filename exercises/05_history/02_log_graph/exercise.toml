description = """
`git log --oneline --graph --all` draws an ASCII graph of your entire commit \
history across all branches. It makes branch points and merges much easier to \
understand than a plain list.

This repository has two branches (`main` and `feature`) that diverged from a \
common ancestor. Use `git log --oneline --graph --all` to visualize the \
history, then count the total number of unique commits across all branches and \
write that number to `answer.txt`.

Tip: Each `*` in the graph output represents one commit.
"""

text = "Write the number to the file: `git rev-list --all --count > answer.txt`"
