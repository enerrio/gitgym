`git log` is your window into a project's history. It shows you the list of \
commits, their authors, dates, and messages.

This repository has a history of commits made during a small project. At some \
point, a critical bug was fixed. Use `git log` to find the commit that fixed \
bug #42, then write its abbreviated commit hash to a file called `answer.txt`.

Tip: `git log --oneline` gives a compact view. You can also pipe through \
`grep` to filter by keyword.
"""

summary = "Write the abbreviated commit hash of the 'Fix: squash bug #42' commit to answer.txt."

text = "Run `git log --oneline` to see a compact list of commits with their abbreviated hashes."

text = "Look for the commit message that mentions bug #42. You can pipe the output: `git log --oneline | grep '#42'`"

[[hints]]
text = "Once you see the hash, write it to the file: `echo <hash> > answer.txt`"
