description = """
`git blame <file>` annotates each line of a file with the commit hash and \
author who last modified it. This is invaluable for tracking down when and why \
a specific line was written.

This repository has a file called `poem.txt` that was written collaboratively \
by several contributors. Use `git blame poem.txt` to find out who wrote \
**line 3**, then write that person's name to `answer.txt`.
"""
