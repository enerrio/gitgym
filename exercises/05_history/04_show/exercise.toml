description = """
`git show <hash>` lets you inspect exactly what a specific commit changed: \
the diff, the author, the date, and the full message. You can also use \
`git show <hash>:<file>` to retrieve the contents of a file as it appeared \
at that commit — even if the file no longer exists.

This repository has a commit with the message "Add launch code". The file \
`launch.txt` was introduced in that commit but was later removed. Use \
`git log --oneline` to find the commit hash, then use `git show` to recover \
the **first line** of `launch.txt` as it appeared in that commit. Write that \
line to `answer.txt`.
