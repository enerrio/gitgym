description = """
`git rebase -i` (interactive rebase) lets you rewrite history by reordering, \
editing, or combining commits. A common use case is **squashing** several \
small or "WIP" commits into one clean commit before merging.

The `feature` branch has three messy WIP commits. Squash all three into a \
single commit using interactive rebase. You are already on the `feature` \
branch.

Run: `git rebase -i main`

In your editor you will see the three commits listed with the word `pick`. \
Change the second and third lines from `pick` to `squash` (or `s`), save, \
and close the editor. Git will prompt you to write a combined commit message \
— write something meaningful (not "WIP").
"""

[goal]
summary = "The feature branch has exactly one commit beyond main, and that commit message does not contain 'WIP'."

text = "Run `git rebase -i main` to open the interactive rebase editor."

text = "In the editor, leave the first line as `pick` and change the other lines from `pick` to `squash` (or just `s`)."

[[hints]]
text = "After saving the rebase plan, Git opens another editor for the combined commit message. Write a clean message (without 'WIP') and save."
