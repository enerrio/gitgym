title = "Rebase a Feature Branch onto Main"
description = """
`git rebase` rewrites a branch so that its commits appear to start from a \
different point. Unlike `git merge`, which creates a merge commit, rebase \
produces a clean, linear history.

In this repository, `main` has moved forward since the `feature` branch was \
created. You are on the `feature` branch. Rebase it onto `main` so that \
`feature`'s commits follow directly after `main`'s latest commit.
