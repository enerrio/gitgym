topic = "Rebase"
title = "Resolve Conflicts During a Rebase"
description = """
When rebasing, git replays each commit from your branch on top of the target \
branch. If a commit touches the same lines that the target branch also \
changed, git will pause the rebase and report a conflict — just like during \
a merge.

Both `main` and `feature` have changed the same line in `config.txt`. Rebase \
`feature` onto `main`, resolve the conflict in `config.txt`, stage the file, \
and continue the rebase with `git rebase --continue`.

You are already on the `feature` branch.
"""

[goal]
summary = "The feature branch is rebased onto main with the conflict in config.txt resolved — no conflict markers remain."

[[hints]]
text = "Run `git rebase main` to start the rebase. Git will pause when it hits the conflict."

[[hints]]
text = "Open `config.txt` and look for conflict markers: <<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. Edit the file to keep the content you want, then remove all markers."

[[hints]]
text = "After editing config.txt, stage it with `git add config.txt`, then run `git rebase --continue` to finish."
