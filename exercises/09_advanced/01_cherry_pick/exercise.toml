title = "Cherry-Pick a Commit from Another Branch"
description = """
`git cherry-pick` lets you apply a single commit from one branch onto \
another. This is useful when you want just one specific change — such as a \
bug fix — without merging the entire branch.

In this repository, a colleague made two commits on the `hotfix` branch:
- "Fix critical login bug" — a fix you need on `main` right now.
- "Clean up old code" — unrelated cleanup you are not ready to merge yet.

You are on the `main` branch. Cherry-pick only the "Fix critical login bug" \
commit from the `hotfix` branch onto `main`.

The file `cherry_pick_this.txt` contains the commit hash of the commit you \
need to cherry-pick.
