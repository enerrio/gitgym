Tags mark specific points in your repository's history — typically release \
versions like `v1.0`. Unlike branches, tags do not move as new commits are \
added.

There are two kinds of tags:
- **Lightweight tag** — just a name pointing to a commit (like a bookmark).
- **Annotated tag** — stores extra metadata: tagger name, date, and a \
message. Annotated tags are recommended for releases.

In this repository, development of version 1.0 is complete. Your tasks are:
1. Create a **lightweight** tag named `v1.0` on the current commit (HEAD).
2. Create an **annotated** tag named `v1.0-release` on the current commit \
   with the message "Release version 1.0".
"""

[goal]
summary = "A lightweight tag v1.0 and an annotated tag v1.0-release (with message 'Release version 1.0') both point to HEAD."

[[hints]]
text = "Create a lightweight tag with: git tag v1.0"

[[hints]]
text = "Create an annotated tag with the -a and -m flags: git tag -a v1.0-release -m 'Release version 1.0'"

[[hints]]
text = "Verify your tags with: git tag -l  and  git show v1.0-release"
