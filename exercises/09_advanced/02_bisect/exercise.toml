title = "Find a Buggy Commit with git bisect"
description = """
`git bisect` performs a binary search through your commit history to find \
the first commit that introduced a bug. You mark one commit as "good" \
(bug-free) and another as "bad" (contains the bug), and git checks out \
commits in between for you to test.

In this repository, a bug was introduced somewhere in the last 7 commits. \
The script `test.sh` exits 0 if the code is correct and 1 if the bug is \
present.

Use `git bisect` with `git bisect run ./test.sh` to automatically find the \
first bad commit. Once bisect finishes, record the full commit hash of the \
first bad commit in a file called `found_commit.txt`, then run \
`git bisect reset` to return to the latest commit.

Useful commands:
  git bisect start
  git bisect bad HEAD
  git bisect good HEAD~6
  git bisect run ./test.sh
  git bisect reset
"""

[goal]
summary = "found_commit.txt contains the hash of the first bad commit, and bisect has been reset."

text = "Start bisect with: git bisect start && git bisect bad HEAD && git bisect good HEAD~6"

text = "Automate the search with: git bisect run ./test.sh"

[[hints]]
text = "After bisect prints the bad commit, run: git bisect reset   Then write the hash to found_commit.txt"
