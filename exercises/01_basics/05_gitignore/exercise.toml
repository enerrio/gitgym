title = "Ignore Files with .gitignore"
description = """
Not every file belongs in version control. Build artifacts, log files, \
and editor configs should usually be excluded. Git reads a `.gitignore` \
file to know which files to skip.

In this exercise, the repo contains two files that should never be \
committed:

  - `build.log`  — a log file generated during builds
  - `secret.key` — a sensitive file that must not be tracked

Create a `.gitignore` that excludes both of these files. The rest of \
the repo should remain unaffected.
"""

[goal]
summary = ".gitignore exists and causes build.log and secret.key to be ignored by git."

text = "Create a file named `.gitignore` in the exercise directory."

[[hints]]
text = "Each line in `.gitignore` is a pattern. Add `build.log` and `secret.key` on separate lines."

[[hints]]
text = "Run `git status` after creating .gitignore — the two files should no longer appear as untracked."
