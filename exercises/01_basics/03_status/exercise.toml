`git status` shows you exactly what is staged, what is modified, and what \
is untracked. In this exercise the repo already has some files committed. \
Three new files have been added:

  - `feature.txt`  — a new file that should be staged
  - `notes.txt`    — a new file that should NOT be staged
  - `readme.txt`   — a previously committed file that has been modified

Your task: stage `feature.txt` and the modified `readme.txt`, but leave \
`notes.txt` untracked.
