title = "Create and Switch to a New Branch"
description = """
Branches let you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main \
codebase. In this exercise, you'll create a new branch called "feature" \
and switch to it so you're ready to start working there.
"""

[goal]
summary = "A branch named 'feature' exists and is the currently active branch."

[[hints]]
text = "Use `git branch` to list existing branches and `git branch <name>` to create a new one."

[[hints]]
text = "After creating the branch, use `git switch feature` (or `git checkout feature`) to switch to it."

[[hints]]
text = "You can do both in one step: `git switch -c feature` (or `git checkout -b feature`)."
