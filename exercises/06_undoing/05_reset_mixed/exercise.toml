description = """
`git reset` (without a flag, or with `--mixed`) moves the branch pointer \
back and also clears the staging area, but leaves your changes in the \
working directory. This lets you revisit what you were working on and \
decide what to stage and commit more carefully.

In this exercise the last commit ("Add everything at once") lumped \
several unrelated changes together. Use `git reset HEAD~1` to undo \
that commit and unstage all the changes. The files will still be \
present in your working directory.
