title = "Revert a Commit Without Rewriting History"
description = """
`git revert <hash>` creates a **new** commit that undoes the changes \
introduced by a previous commit. Unlike `git reset`, revert does not \
rewrite history — the original commit stays in the log, and a new \
"revert" commit is added on top. This makes it safe to use on shared \
branches.

In this repository a commit with the message "Add debug output" \
introduced an unwanted line in `app.py`. Revert that commit to \
remove the debug output without altering the prior history.
"""

[goal]
summary = "A revert commit exists that undoes 'Add debug output', and app.py no longer contains the debug line."

[[hints]]
text = "Use `git log --oneline` to find the hash of the 'Add debug output' commit."

[[hints]]
text = "Look at the `git revert` command."

[[hints]]
text = "Run `git revert <hash>` (use --no-edit to keep the default message, or type your own)."
