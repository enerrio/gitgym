You've staged a file with `git add`, but then realised you're not ready to \
commit it yet. `git restore --staged <file>` removes the file from the \
staging area while keeping your changes safely in the working directory.

In this exercise, `notes.txt` has been accidentally staged. Unstage it \
without discarding the changes you made to it.
