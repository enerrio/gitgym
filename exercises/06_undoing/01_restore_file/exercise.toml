description = """
Sometimes you edit a file and then realize you want to throw away those \
changes and go back to how it looked in the last commit. \
`git restore <file>` does exactly that — it discards working directory \
changes and resets the file to its committed version.

In this exercise, `config.txt` was committed with some settings, but \
someone modified it afterwards and the changes were never staged. Use \
`git restore` to discard the working directory changes and bring the file \
back to its last committed state.
