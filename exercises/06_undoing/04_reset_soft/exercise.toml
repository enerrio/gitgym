title = "Uncommit but Keep Changes Staged"
description = """
`git reset --soft HEAD~1` moves the branch pointer back by one commit but \
leaves the changes from that commit **in the staging area**. This is useful \
when you committed too soon and want to re-do the commit with a better \
message or combined with other changes.

In this exercise the last commit ("WIP: half-done feature") was made \
prematurely. Use `git reset --soft` to undo that commit while keeping the \
changes staged so you can amend or re-commit them.
